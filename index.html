<p>Please &amp; Thank You.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-you-">Where are you?</h2>
<p>You probably have questions where you, and what cats have to do with any of this.<br>All of this will become clear with time, quite literally.<br>Except the cats. 
<br><br>For now though you may have to wait.<br>This is an active project and still in development.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-do-">What can you do?</h2>
<p>Feel free to explore.<br>There are only three <em>Rules</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explore this page<br>Stay Kind<br>And no cats were harmed in the production of this website.<br>
  <button onclick="takeTo()" style=" width: 250px;
                  height: 18px;
                  background-color: #1a1a1a;
                  border: #1a1a1a;">
  </button><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And one last thing.<br>Just remember not every mistake is unintentional.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">

      }
      else {
        numClick = numClick + 1;
